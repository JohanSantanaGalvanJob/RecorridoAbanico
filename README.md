Exercise made in class which consists on developing a program made in Python.

Firstly, we need to create a maze of 10x10 covered with 1 creating a wall. Then, we have to create an Agent class that will have the x, y position and a method of moving the Agent in eight possible directions.

Once the method is made. Now you have to implement it with an algorithm that will be choosing every single posibility of path in the maze so that the agent will get to the exit.
